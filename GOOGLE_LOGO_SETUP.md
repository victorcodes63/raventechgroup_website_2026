# How to Add Your Logo to Google Search Results

## Why Your Logo Isn't Showing

Google requires logos to be uploaded directly in Google Search Console, not just referenced in structured data. The structured data helps, but you need to upload the logo in Search Console.

## 📋 Step-by-Step: Add Logo to Google Search Console

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo

Your logo needs to meet Google's requirements:

- **Format**: PNG or SVG
- **Size**: 
  - Minimum: 112 x 112 pixels
  - Maximum: 1,000,000 pixels (width × height)
  - Recommended: Square format (e.g., 512 x 512)
- **File Size**: Under 1MB
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color
- **Content**: Logo only (no text, no taglines)

### Step 2: Create a Square Logo Version (If Needed)

Your current logo (`raven_logo.png`) is 694 x 253 (rectangular). For best results:

**Option A: Use Square Icon**
- Use `/images/logos/raven-Square Icon.png` if it's square
- Or create a square version of your logo

**Option B: Use Favicon**
- The 512x512 favicon might work: `/images/favicon/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`

### Step 3: Upload in Google Search Console

1. **Go to Google Search Console**: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. **Select your property**: `www.raventechgroup.com`
3. **Go to Settings** (gear icon in bottom left)
4. **Click "Branding"** (in the left sidebar)
5. **Click "Add logo"** or "Edit logo"
6. **Upload your logo**:
   - Choose a square logo (112x112 minimum, 512x512 recommended)
   - Or use your square icon if available
7. **Save**

### Step 4: Wait for Approval

- Google reviews logos (can take a few days to weeks)
- You'll get a notification when approved
- Once approved, the logo will appear in search results

## 🎨 Recommended Logo Files

Based on what you have:

1. **Best Option**: Create a square version of your logo (512x512px)
   - Use your existing logo
   - Make it square with transparent or brand-colored background
   - Save as PNG

2. **Quick Option**: Use the square icon
   - `/images/logos/raven-Square Icon.png` (if it's square)

3. **Alternative**: Use the 512x512 favicon
   - `/images/favicon/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`

## ✅ What We've Already Done

- ✅ Organization schema includes logo reference
- ✅ Logo URL is in structured data
- ✅ Logo dimensions specified in schema

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Logo Review**: Google manually reviews logos, so it can take time
2. **Square Format**: Square logos work best (Google may crop rectangular ones)
3. **Quality**: Use high-quality, clear logo
4. **No Text**: Logo should be just the logo mark, not with company name text
5. **Transparent Background**: Preferred, but solid color works too

## 🔍 Check Current Logo

Your current logo file:
- Path: `/images/logos/raven_logo.png`
- Size: 694 x 253 pixels (rectangular)
- Format: PNG

**Recommendation**: Create a square version (512x512) for Google Search Console upload.

## 📝 After Upload

Once uploaded and approved:
- Logo will appear in Google Knowledge Graph
- Shows in search results for brand searches
- Appears in Google Business Profile (if you have one)

**Next Step**: Go to Google Search Console → Settings → Branding → Upload your square logo!
